Practice building linear regression

Overview
This activity will provide you with the opportunity to practice building multiple linear regression models using R. This activity has been adapted from an excellent resource provided on www.statistics.laerd.com. This site provides tutorials that are specific to the statistical software SPSS, however the concepts behind each of the statistical models are still relevant. I recommend checking out this site for more information on a range of different statistical concepts.
